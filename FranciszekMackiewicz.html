							The Most Illustrious, Excellent and Eminent Reverend<br>
							BORGIASZ ŁUKASZ MACHWICZ MACKIEWICZ.
							<br><br>
							Born on 10 October 1756 in the Diocese of Kraków (once a Palatinate/Voivodeship, now [part of] the Governorate of Lublin) in Poland. In the year 1786, he was sent away from the Diocese of Kraków; he was ordained to minor orders in 1787 in the presence of His Holy Majesty the King of Poland, in the town of Kaniów. He was ordained to higher orders<sup><a href = "#2">2</a></sup> in 1788 at Lutsk. Finally, in the year 1789, he was ordained into the priesthood (as vicar of Basal) in the city of Dubno. In 1792, he was made a professor of moral theology in the seminary of Lutsk, and a preacher in its cathedral church. From 1 September 1796, he was under the bishop of Letychiv, and was in its consistory; [when] it was restored to the Diocese of Kamieniets in 1798, in the consistory at Kamieniets-Podilskyi, [he was made] dean of Letychiv after the manner of Kamieniets-Podilskyi, with the use of the distinctions of honorary canon and secretary. In 1797, he was appointed assessor in the consistory of Kamieniets; in 1804, titular canon of [the cathedral chapter of] Kamieniets-Podilskyi; in 1806, assessor to the Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical College at St. Petersburg. In 1808, he was nominated suffragan bishop of Kamieniets-Podilskyi, [though] not as coadjutor bishop of Kamieniets-Podilskyi; in the same year, he was made a dean of the cathedral [chapter]. In 1809, he was announced Doctor of Sacred Theology and Canon Law, from the department of literature of the University of Vilnius. In the same year, the seat of the bishop of Kamieniets-Podilskyi was vacant; and having served in the College of Assessor, he was elected diocesan administrator of the diocese by the cathedral chapter of Kamieniets, and soon after was nominated as bishop of Kamieniets. On 12 August 1812, he was awarded a full administratorial bronze [pectoral] cross. In 1814, he was confirmed as bishop at Rome by the Holy Apostolic See; he was consecrated as bishop of Kamieniets-Podilskyi [in?] Lutsk on 8 April 1817. In 1819, he was awarded the Order of St. Anna, 1st class, by Alexander I, then with an imperial crown in 1832; finally, in 1839, he was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir, 2nd class, by Nicolas I, and decorated with the honor of "Knight and Most Vigilant Shepherd". In the current year 1840, the 50th year of his priesthood, the cathedral chapter of Kamieniets-Podilskyi offers this image, drawn in stown, in everlasting memory of a grateful soul.
