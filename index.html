			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>To summarize &mdash; I go by Athanaius on the internet. I'm a high school student mainly interested in church history relating to Poland, the classics (especially the Latin & Koine Greek languages), computer science, and about a thousand other things.<br><br>Geographically, I live in the midwestern United States. Not much personal information of me is needed besides that.</p>
			<h2><b>Works</b></h2>
			<p>These should less be considered "works" and more like "projects".<br><br>In these, anything in italics is Latin text that has not yet been translated into English. Brackets indicate insertions to make the text flow better in English, or guesses at what words could mean.</p>
